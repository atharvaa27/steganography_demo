# 🕵️‍♀️ Steganography Demo: Hiding Messages in Images

Welcome to the Steganography Demo! This project showcases how messages can be hidden inside images using a web-based encoder/decoder.

## 🔍 What Is Steganography?

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file. Unlike encryption, it hides the existence of the communication altogether.

In this demo, we hide text inside images and decode it later — the image looks exactly the same to the human eye!

## 📷 Demo Flow

1. Select an image (e.g., `original_flower.png`)
2. Encode a message like:
   > _"Hi there, I hope you have a blessed day ahead!"_
3. Download the resulting image: `message_flower.png`
4. Upload it again to decode and extract the hidden message
